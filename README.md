# Homelab 

Welcome to the **Homelab** repository — a collection of guides, templates, and reference configurations used throughout my YouTube homelab series.


This repo acts as a **public knowledge base**, helping you:
- Install and configure Proxmox
- Deploy LXCs and VMs
- Set up services like the Arr-suite, Samba, Plex, Grafana, and more
- Follow along with each video using clean, reproducible steps


> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository contains *example* configurations, **not** my personal network, passwords, or deployments.
